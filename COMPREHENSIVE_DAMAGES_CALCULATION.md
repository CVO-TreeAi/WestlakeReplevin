In determining the defendant's liability for any additional statutory damages, the court shall consider the nature of the defendant's noncompliance with s. 559.72, the frequency and persistence of the noncompliance, and the extent to which the noncompliance was intentional.**

2. **Johnson v. Columbia Debt Recovery** - $30,000 FDCPA emotional distress
3. **Florida Supreme Court** - Punitive damages up to 3x compensatory or $500,000

### B. Statutory Authority

Each damage component derives from specific statutory authority with full compliance with statutory caps and requirements.

### C. Proportionality Analysis

The damages are proportional to Defendant's egregious conduct:

- Fraudulent federal tax document filing  
- Nighttime theft operations endangering the security and soverginty of Plantiffs home with children inside
- Systematic violations of multiple federal and state laws

## VIII. CONCLUSION

Plaintiff's damages of approximately $429,000 represent the legally mandated consequences of Defendant's systematic violations of federal and state consumer protection laws. The calculation provides conservative estimates based on established case law and statutory authority.

The Court should find these damages appropriate given the severity, duration, and intentional nature of Defendant's violations.
