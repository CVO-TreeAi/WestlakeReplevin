v.                                           Case No. 6:25-cv-01677

Defendant.

## PLAINTIFF'S MOTION TO REMAND TO STATE COURT

TO THE HONORABLE COURT:

Plaintiff Jeremiah-Matthew Anderson, appearing pro se, respectfully moves this Court to remand this action to the Circuit Court of Volusia County, Florida, and states:

## I. DEFENDANT'S REMOVAL IS PROCEDURALLY DEFECTIVE AND MADE IN BAD FAITH

**1. UNTIMELY REMOVAL BASED ON FALSE "DISCOVERY" CLAIM**

Defendant claims it "discovered" Plaintiff's Second Amended Complaint on August 11, 2025, and filed removal within 30 days. This is a blatant misrepresentation designed to circumvent the removal deadline.

**The undisputed facts:**
- Defendant was properly served through the LA County Sheriff's Department as ordered by the 7th Circuit Court
- Defendant had actual and constructive notice of all proceedings, inlcuding multiple seperate occasions inlcuding certified mail in additon to the LASD serving them legally. 
- Defendant deliberately ignored court proceedings and failed to appear at hearings
- Only after losing by default judgment did Defendant suddenly "discover" the case

**This calculated ignorance cannot reset the removal clock.** Defendant's attempt to manipulate federal jurisdiction through willful blindness is procedurally improper and made in bad faith. Why would they possibly want to move towards the jurisdiciton that has more authority directly over their now apparent interstate fraudulent activiites. I am not here to assit in righting all their wrongs. I am simply here to be made whole after the theft of my private property. To say this is a "mistaken repo" or anything else is a direct insult and further attack on myself and my rights. 

**2. STRATEGIC FORUM SHOPPING TO AVOID ACCOUNTABILITY**

Defendant's removal is nothing more than forum shopping to escape the consequences of their misconduct:

- **Ignored proper service** and court orders
- **Failed to appear** at scheduled hearings  
- **Lost by default** due to their own neglect
- **Only then hired counsel** to retroactively attack the case
- **Moved to federal court** to start over and avoid state court rulings

This Court should not reward such manipulative litigation tactics.

## II. DEFENDANT LACKS STANDING AND CANNOT ESTABLISH FEDERAL JURISDICTION

**3. NO VALID CONTRACT = NO STANDING TO REMOVE**

Defendant's own filings prove they have **no legal relationship** with Plaintiff:

- Defendant operates **only** as "WESTLAKE SERVICES, LLC d/b/a WESTLAKE FINANCIAL SERVICES"
- The contract at issue names "**WESTLAKE FINANCIAL**" - a different entity
- Defendant has **admitted** they are not "Westlake Financial"
- **No valid contract exists** between these parties

**Without a valid contract, Defendant lacks standing to remove this case or assert any claims.**

**4. STATE LAW CLAIMS PREDOMINATE - NO FEDERAL JURISDICTION**

This case centers on:
- **Theft of Plaintiff's property** in Volusia County, Florida
- **Violation of Florida replevin statutes**
- **Breach of contract under Florida law**  
- **Florida civil theft statutes**
- **Florida Consumer Collection Practices Act**

The federal claims are supplemental at best. **Florida state court is the proper forum** for these predominantly state law claims involving Florida property, Florida defendants' conduct, and Florida residents.

## III. DEFENDANT'S CONDUCT DEMONSTRATES CONTEMPT FOR THE JUDICIAL PROCESS

**5. PATTERN OF DISRESPECT AND MANIPULATION**

Defendant's conduct throughout this litigation shows:

- **Deliberate evasion** of proper service and court proceedings
- **Calculated non-appearance** at hearings to avoid adverse rulings
- **Retroactive lawyering** only after losing by default
- **Forum shopping** to federal court to escape state court authority
- **Frivolous procedural attacks** instead of addressing the merits

**This Court should not enable such behavior by accepting improper removal.**

## IV. THE MERITS FAVOR PLAINTIFF AND DEFENDANT KNOWS IT

**6. DEFENDANT CANNOT WIN ON THE MERITS**

The evidence is clear:
- Defendant **repossessed and sold** Plaintiff's vehicle
- Defendant **had no valid contract** with Plaintiff  
- Defendant **violated federal debt collection laws**
- Defendant **ignored proper legal process**

**Defendant's removal is a desperate attempt to avoid inevitable liability through procedural manipulation.**

## CONCLUSION AND PRAYER FOR RELIEF

Defendant's removal violates federal removal statutes, is procedurally defective, made in bad faith, and represents blatant forum shopping. **This Court lacks subject matter jurisdiction** over what is fundamentally a Florida state law dispute.

**WHEREFORE,** Plaintiff respectfully requests this Court:

1. **GRANT this Motion to Remand** to Volusia County Circuit Court;
2. **AWARD Plaintiff costs and attorney fees** pursuant to 28 U.S.C. ยง 1447(c);
3. **SANCTION Defendant** for improper removal made in bad faith; and
4. Grant such other relief as this Court deems just and proper.

**Respectfully submitted,**
