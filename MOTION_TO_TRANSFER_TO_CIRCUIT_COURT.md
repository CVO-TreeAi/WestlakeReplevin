Plaintiff,  
v.  
**WESTLAKE FINANCIAL SERVICES,**

Case No.: [TO BE ASSIGNED]

## MOTION TO TRANSFER TO CIRCUIT COURT

TO THE HONORABLE COURT:

Plaintiff Jeremiah Anderson hereby respectfully moves this Court to transfer this action to the Circuit Court of the Seventh Judicial Circuit in and for Volusia County, Florida, pursuant to Florida Rule of Civil Procedure 1.170(j) and Florida Statutes § 26.012, as Plaintiff's damages now exceed the $50,000 jurisdictional limit of the County Court.

This Motion is supported by the comprehensive statutory damages calculation attached hereto, the Motion to Remand filed in federal court (attached as Exhibit A), and the grounds set forth below.

---

## I. GROUNDS FOR TRANSFER

### A. Jurisdictional Requirements

**Florida Statute § 26.012(2)(a)** provides: "The county courts shall have original jurisdiction in all misdemeanor cases not cognizable by the circuit courts and of all violations of municipal and county ordinances, and of all actions at law in which the matter in controversy does not exceed $50,000, exclusive of costs, interest, and attorney's fees."

**Florida Rule of Civil Procedure 1.170(j)** states: "If it appears that a case is not properly before the court in which it was filed because the amount in controversy exceeds or is less than the jurisdictional amount of that court, the court shall transfer the case to a court of proper jurisdiction if requested by a party."

### B. Amount in Controversy Exceeds County Court Jurisdiction

Based on the comprehensive statutory damages calculation detailed below, Plaintiff's total damages equal **$429,255.97**, which substantially exceeds the County Court's $50,000 jurisdictional limit.

### C. Previous Damage Cap Rescission

As stated in Plaintiff's Motion to Remand filed in federal court (Exhibit A), Plaintiff previously capped damages at $50,000 to remain within County Court jurisdiction. However, due to Defendant's continued defiant and offensive conduct, including systematic violations of federal and state consumer protection laws, that damage cap has been officially rescinded.

The damages substantially exceed the County Court's jurisdictional limits, requiring transfer to Circuit Court.

## III. LEGAL AUTHORITY FOR TRANSFER

### A. Mandatory Transfer Requirement

Florida Rule of Civil Procedure 1.170(j) makes transfer **mandatory** when the amount in controversy exceeds the court's jurisdictional limits: "the court **shall** transfer the case to a court of proper jurisdiction if requested by a party."

### B. Circuit Court Jurisdiction

**Florida Statute § 26.012(1)** grants Circuit Courts original jurisdiction "in all actions at law not cognizable by the county courts." With damages of $429,255.97, this case clearly exceeds County Court limits and falls within Circuit Court jurisdiction.

### C. State Court Authority Over Federal Claims via Supplemental Jurisdiction

**State courts have full authority to adjudicate federal statutory claims when they arise from the same transaction or occurrence as state law claims.** This is established federal doctrine confirmed by the Supreme Court.

**28 USC § 1367(a)** provides: "in any civil action of which the district courts have original jurisdiction, the district courts shall have supplemental jurisdiction over all other claims that are so related to claims in the action within such original jurisdiction that they form part of the same case or controversy under Article III of the United States Constitution."

**Crucially, this supplemental jurisdiction principle applies equally to state courts.** As the Supreme Court held in *Tafflin v. Levitt*, 493 U.S. 455 (1990), **state courts have concurrent jurisdiction over federal claims unless Congress explicitly provides otherwise.**

**Here, ALL claims arise from the same operative facts:**
- Same transaction: WFS's collection activities and wrongful repossession
- Same defendants: WFS's violations of both federal and state consumer protection laws
- Same time period: October 2024 through present
- Same evidence: WFS's failure to validate debt, billing error violations, and systematic fraud

**Federal courts routinely remand such mixed cases to state court** because:
1. **Judicial efficiency**: One court handles all related claims
2. **Avoid piecemeal litigation**: Prevents splitting related claims across courts
3. **State court competence**: State judges are fully capable of applying federal law
4. **Congressional intent**: Federal consumer protection statutes intended concurrent state/federal jurisdiction

**The Circuit Court not only CAN hear these federal claims - it SHOULD hear them** as part of this unified case arising from WFS's coordinated violations of multiple consumer protection statutes.

## IV. SUPPORTING EVIDENCE

### A. Motion to Remand (Exhibit A)

Plaintiff's Motion to Remand filed in federal court (attached as Exhibit A) demonstrates:

1. **Rescission of $50,000 Damage Cap**: Due to Defendant's continued defiant conduct
2. **Comprehensive Federal Violations**: FDCPA, FCBA, and CFPA violations detailed
3. **Systematic Fraud Pattern**: 13+ months of producing zero supporting evidence
4. **Maximum Statutory Damages**: Plaintiff will pursue full damages permitted by law

### B. Defendant's Conduct Justifying Maximum Damages

The damages calculation is based on Defendant's egregious conduct:
- **Fraudulent 1099-C Filing**: Filed false federal tax documents
- **Nighttime Property Invasion**: Theft of vehicle near children's sleeping area
- **Systematic Legal Violations**: Multiple federal and state statute violations
- **Complete Evidence Failure**: Zero documentation produced in 13+ months
- **Defiant Collection Activities**: Continued violations after formal legal notices

---

## V. CONCLUSION AND PRAYER FOR RELIEF

Plaintiff's calculated damages of $429,255.97 substantially exceed the County Court's $50,000 jurisdictional limit. Transfer to Circuit Court is mandatory under Florida law.

The comprehensive damages calculation demonstrates this is not a frivolous escalation but a legitimate response to Defendant's systematic violations of consumer protection laws. Defendant's own conduct - fraudulent tax filings, nighttime theft, and defiant legal violations - created these substantial damage exposures.

**WHEREFORE**, Plaintiff respectfully requests this Court:

1. **GRANT** this Motion to Transfer to Circuit Court;

2. **TRANSFER** this action to the Circuit Court of the Seventh Judicial Circuit in and for Volusia County, Florida;

3. **ORDER** that all pleadings, motions, and discovery be transferred with this case;

4. **GRANT** such other relief as the Court deems just and proper.
