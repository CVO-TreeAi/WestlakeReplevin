v.  
**WESTLAKE FINANCIAL SERVICES,**  
Defendant.  

Case No.: [TO BE FILLED]

## MOTION TO REMAND TO STATE COURT

TO THE HONORABLE COURT:

Plaintiff Jeremiah Anderson hereby moves this Court to remand this action to the state court from which it was removed. This Motion is made and based upon the grounds set forth herein and the entire record in this case.

## I. STATEMENT OF FACTS

Defendant Westlake Financial Services ("WFS") initiated collection activities against Plaintiff without any valid legal relationship or contractual privity. The undisputed facts demonstrate a pattern of fraudulent conduct and willful violations of federal consumer protection statutes.

### Timeline of Material Events:

1. **Payment Instructions Packet**: Plaintiff sent a payment instructions packet to WFS containing specific instructions for debt discharge, including directing WFS to "send receipt for discharge to the address above."

2. **Intentional 1099-C Issuance**: WFS deliberately complied with Plaintiff's payment instructions and issued a 1099-C "Cancellation of Debt" form to Jeremiah Anderson. This was not an error - WFS intentionally filed this federal tax document stating the debt was cancelled.

3. **Tax Filing**: Plaintiff relied on WFS's 1099-C cancellation and filed taxes accordingly, later discovering the document was fraudulent since WFS had no authority to cancel debt they never had legal claim to.

4. **Collection Restart**: Several weeks after issuing the 1099-C, WFS began sending collection notices despite having officially cancelled the debt.

5. **August 20, 2024**: Plaintiff served WFS with an Affidavit Notice of Billing Error at 3:36 PM, delivered and signed by employee "JL" per Post Master's report. This document began: "NOTICE TO AGENT IS NOTICE TO PRINCIPAL, NOTICE TO PRINCIPAL IS NOTICE TO AGENT."

6. **October 12, 2024**: WFS responded to the lawful billing error notice by sending threats of repossession.

7. **October 24, 2024**: At 6:39 PM, USPS delivered Plaintiff's complete debt validation request packet to WFS via priority flat rate envelope pursuant to 15 USC § 1692g.

8. **Federal Law Violation**: Under 15 USC § 1692g(b), WFS was required by federal law to "cease collection of the debt" until validation was provided. WFS willfully ignored this mandatory cessation requirement.

9. **Defiant Repossession**: In direct defiance of federal law requiring cessation of collection activities, WFS arranged for repossession of Plaintiff's vehicle.

10. **Corporate Identity Revelation**: Following the repossession, it became clear that the original contract named "Westlake Financial" but WFS (Westlake Financial Services) is a different entity that had no legal authority to enforce the contract or repossess property. Per their own filings they defiantly claimed that Westlake Finacial is no their name and the order granting replevin should be reversed. The defendent had a legal court order for replevin reveresed to prove their legally binding identifiable name is resolutley NOT Westlake Financial and is in fact WESTLAKE SERVICES LLC. dba WESTLAKE FINANCIAL SERVICES. (Defendent's Motion to Vacate Order Granting REpleving and Writ of Replevin- Filed by the Defendent on 1/17/2025)

11. **Destruction of Evidence**: WFS immediately sold the stolen vehicle at auction, making physical recovery impossible and destroying evidence of Plaintiff's substantial improvements.

## II. APPLICABLE FEDERAL STATUTES

### A. Fair Debt Collection Practices Act - 15 USC § 1692g (Validation of Debts)

**Full Text of 15 USC § 1692g:**

**(a) Notice of debt; contents**
Within five days after the initial communication with a consumer in connection with the collection of any debt, a debt collector shall, unless the following information is contained in the initial communication or the consumer has paid the debt, send the consumer a written notice containing—
(1) the amount of the debt;
(2) the name of the creditor to whom the debt is owed;
(3) a statement that unless the consumer, within thirty days after receipt of the notice, disputes the validity of the debt, or any portion thereof, the debt will be assumed to be valid by the debt collector;
(4) a statement that if the consumer notifies the debt collector in writing within the thirty-day period that the debt, or any portion thereof, is disputed, the debt collector will obtain verification of the debt or a copy of a judgment against the consumer and a copy of such verification or judgment will be mailed to the consumer by the debt collector; and
(5) a statement that, upon the consumer's written request within the thirty-day period, the debt collector will provide the consumer with the name and address of the original creditor, if different from the current creditor.

**(b) Disputed debts**
If the consumer notifies the debt collector in writing within the thirty-day period described in subsection (a)(3) that the debt, or any portion thereof, is disputed, or that the consumer requests the name and address of the original creditor, the debt collector shall cease collection of the debt, or any disputed portion thereof, until the debt collector obtains verification of the debt or a copy of a judgment, or the name and address of the original creditor, and a copy of such verification or judgment, or name and address of the original creditor, is mailed to the consumer by the debt collector.

**(c) Collection activities and communications during 30-day period**
Collection activities and communications that do not otherwise violate this subchapter may continue during the 30-day period referred to in subsection (a)(3) unless the consumer has notified the debt collector in writing that the debt, or any portion of the debt, is disputed or that the consumer requests the name and address of the original creditor. Any collection activities and communication during the 30-day period may not overshadow or be inconsistent with the disclosure of the consumer's right to dispute the debt or request the name and address of the original creditor.

**(d) Mailing address**
For purposes of this section, the consumer's obligation to dispute the validity of the debt, or any portion thereof, may only be fulfilled by written notification to the debt collector at the address disclosed under subsection (a)(5).

**WFS VIOLATIONS**: WFS failed to validate the debt as required by law. Under the doctrine of tacit acquiescence, WFS's failure to validate constitutes admission that no valid debt exists.

### B. Fair Credit Billing Act - 15 USC § 1666(b)(B)(i)

**Full Text of 15 USC § 1666(b)(B)(i):**

The creditor shall, unless the obligor has, after giving such written notice and before the expiration of the time limits herein specified, agreed that the statement was correct—
(i) not later than thirty days after the receipt of the notice, send a written acknowledgment thereof to the obligor, unless the action required in subparagraph (B) is taken within such thirty-day period, and
(ii) not later than two complete billing cycles of the creditor (in no event later than ninety days) after the receipt of the notice, send a written explanation or clarification to the obligor, after having conducted an investigation, setting forth to the extent applicable the reasons why the creditor believes the account of the obligor was correctly shown in the statement and, upon request of the obligor, provide copies of documentary evidence of the obligor's indebtedness; or make appropriate corrections in the account of the obligor, including the crediting of any finance charges on amounts erroneously billed, and transmit to the obligor an explanation of such corrections and the creditor's action with respect to any finance charges or other charges, and notify the obligor of any right to have an amount of the account not being forfeited under any applicable provision of law.

**WFS VIOLATIONS**: WFS failed to acknowledge or respond to Defendant's billing error notice within the required timeframes.

### C. Fair Credit Billing Act - 15 USC § 1666(e)

**Full Text of 15 USC § 1666(e):**

Any creditor who fails to comply with the requirements of this section or section 1666a of this title forfeits any right to collect from the obligor the amount indicated by the obligor under paragraph (2) of subsection (a) of this section, and any finance charges thereon, except that the amount required to be forfeited under this subsection may not exceed $50.

**WFS VIOLATIONS**: WFS forfeited any right to collect due to non-compliance with billing error procedures.

### D. Consumer Financial Protection Act - 12 USC § 5562(c)(10)

**Full Text of 12 USC § 5562(c)(10):**

Within the Civil Investigative Demand authority, the Bureau may require the production of documentary material for inspection, copying, or reproduction. Each civil investigative demand for the production of documentary material shall describe each class of documentary material to be produced under the demand with such definiteness and certainty as to permit such material to be fairly identified, specify a reasonable time within which the material so demanded is to be produced, and identify the custodian to whom such material shall be made available for inspection, copying, or reproduction.

**APPLICATION**: This provision establishes that documentary evidence must be specifically identified with definiteness and certainty. WFS's reliance on a RICSA contract that explicitly names parties other than WFS fails this standard.

### E. FTC Holder Rule - 16 CFR § 433.3(b)(4)

**Full Text of 16 CFR § 433.3(b)(4):**

Contract which does not cut off consumers' claims and defenses: A consumer credit contract which does not constitute or contain a negotiable instrument, or contain any waiver, limitation, term, or condition which has the effect of limiting a consumer's right to assert against any holder of the contract all legally sufficient claims and defenses which the consumer could assert against the seller of goods or services purchased pursuant to the contract.

**APPLICATION**: Consumers retain all claims and defenses against assignees. WFS cannot claim rights superior to the original creditor without proper validation.

## III. LEGAL ARGUMENT

### A. State Court is the Proper Forum for This Mixed Federal-State Case

While federal statutes are implicated, **state courts have concurrent jurisdiction over federal consumer protection claims** when they arise from the same transaction as state law claims. *Tafflin v. Levitt*, 493 U.S. 455 (1990).

**Federal courts routinely remand such mixed cases** because:
1. **Primary state law claims**: Theft of property, wrongful repossession, and Florida consumer protection violations
2. **Supplemental federal claims**: FDCPA, FCBA, and CFPA violations arising from the same operative facts  
3. **Judicial efficiency**: One court should handle all related claims from WFS's coordinated violations
4. **State court competence**: State judges are fully capable of applying federal consumer protection law

This case fundamentally involves **state law property theft** with related federal violations - exactly the type of case that belongs in state court under principles of comity and judicial economy.

### B. Defendant's Improper Removal Constitutes Procedural Manipulation

**Any competent attorney practicing consumer law knows that mixed federal-state cases arising from the same transaction belong in state court.** The doctrine of concurrent jurisdiction and federal courts' preference for remanding supplemental claims to state court is basic civil procedure.

**WFS's removal to federal court is not based on legal merit but constitutes bad faith procedural manipulation** designed to:

1. **Delay Resolution**: Force Plaintiff through additional procedural hurdles while WFS continues to avoid producing evidence
2. **Increase Costs**: Burden pro se Plaintiff with federal court procedures and higher filing fees
3. **Forum Shopping**: Attempt to escape state court where WFS's 13+ months of stonewalling is well-documented
4. **Waste Judicial Resources**: Force federal court to analyze state law property theft claims

**This removal pattern is consistent with WFS's 13-month strategy** of using procedural noise to avoid addressing the merits:
- **Zero evidence produced** in over 13 months of litigation
- **Zero response to debt validation** requests as required by federal law
- **Zero justification for 1099-C** cancellation followed by continued collection
- **Zero explanation** for nighttime theft of property they admittedly have no contractual claim to

**WFS's counsel knows this case belongs in state court** but filed for removal anyway as part of their systematic strategy to avoid accountability through procedural obstruction rather than legal merit.

The Court should consider **sanctions under 28 USC § 1447(c)** for this improper removal, as WFS lacks objective good faith basis for believing federal court is the proper forum for a state law property theft case with supplemental federal claims.

### C. WFS Lacks Standing

1. **No Contractual Privity**: The RICSA contract relied upon by WFS explicitly names parties other than WFS, establishing WFS has no direct contractual relationship with Defendant.

2. **Fraudulent Documentation**: WFS's issuance of a 1099-C "Cancellation of Debt" form constitutes judicial admission that any claimed debt was cancelled.

3. **Failure to Validate**: Under 15 USC § 1692g, WFS's failure to validate the debt within statutory timeframes results in invalidation by tacit acquiescence.

### D. Federal Statutory Violations Establish Lack of Standing

WFS's continued collection activities after:
- Receiving formal debt validation requests
- Issuing a 1099-C cancellation 
- Receiving billing error notices
- Failing to comply with federal validation requirements

demonstrate willful violations of federal consumer protection statutes that preclude any claim to the property.

### E. Lack of Legal Authority - Wrong Corporate Entity

The fundamental issue is now clear: WFS had no legal authority to collect, repossess, or enforce any contract rights:

1. **Contract Names Different Entity**: The original contract names "Westlake Financial" as the creditor, not "Westlake Financial Services" (WFS).

2. **WFS Correctly States Non-Identity**: In their Motion to Vacate, WFS correctly states they are "Westlake Services, LLC dba Westlake Financial Services" - acknowledging they are NOT "Westlake Financial."

3. **No Assignment Documentation**: WFS has never produced valid assignment documentation transferring rights from "Westlake Financial" to "Westlake Financial Services."

4. **Intentional 1099-C Fraud**: WFS knowingly issued a 1099-C cancellation document for debt they had no legal claim to - constituting falsification of federal tax records.

5. **No Standing to Collect**: As WFS admits they are not the named creditor in the contract, they lack standing to collect, report to credit bureaus, or repossess property.

**THE CORE FRAUD**: WFS operated for years as if they were "Westlake Financial" without legal authority:
- Collecting on contracts where they are not named
- Reporting false information to credit bureaus 
- Arranging armed repossession of property they have no claim to
- Filing fraudulent 1099-C tax documents

This is not a "shell game" - this is criminal impersonation of a creditor and theft of private property.

### F. WFS's Complete Failure to Produce Evidence (August 8, 2024 - September 1, 2025)

Over thirteen months of litigation, WFS has failed to produce a single piece of evidence supporting their claims or justifying their actions:

1. **Zero Evidence of Legal Authority**: Despite multiple opportunities, WFS has never produced assignment documentation showing transfer of rights from "Westlake Financial" to "Westlake Financial Services."

2. **Zero Evidence of Debt Validation**: WFS received Plaintiff's debt validation request on October 24, 2024, yet has never provided the validation required by 15 USC § 1692g.

3. **Zero Response to Billing Error Notice**: WFS received Plaintiff's billing error notice on August 20, 2024, yet never provided the acknowledgment or investigation required by 15 USC § 1666.

4. **Zero Justification for 1099-C**: WFS has never explained how they had authority to issue tax documents cancelling debt they claim to own.

5. **Procedural Obstruction**: Rather than address the undeniable evidence, WFS has filed volumes of procedural motions attempting to bury the facts under legal noise.

**THE TELLING SILENCE**: WFS cannot move forward because they know they are 100% wrong. Every fact supports Plaintiff's case. Every statute proves WFS's violations. Every document demonstrates WFS's lack of standing.

WFS's litigation strategy reveals their knowledge of guilt: avoid the evidence, create procedural distractions, hope the Court gets lost in the noise rather than examining the crystal-clear facts.

### G. Theft of Property and Nighttime Enforcement Against American Families

1. **Theft Under Cover of Darkness**: WFS arranged for agents to steal Plaintiff's vehicle in the middle of the night, mere feet from where Plaintiff's children sleep.

2. **No Legal Authority**: Without valid contractual privity, debt validation, or response to billing error notices, this constitutes theft under state law.

3. **Destruction of Evidence**: WFS immediately sold the stolen vehicle, making physical recovery impossible and destroying evidence of Plaintiff's improvements including a new engine and complete brake system overhaul.

4. **Anti-American Conduct**: The use of nighttime enforcement against American families on private property, ordered by entities with no legal standing, represents a direct attack on constitutional freedoms.

5. **Cowardly Tactics**: The nighttime theft was calculated to avoid confrontation, demonstrating WFS's knowledge that their actions lacked legal authority.

## IV. CONCLUSION

WFS's conduct represents everything wrong with corporate America's assault on individual rights. Through fraudulent corporate identity games, issuance of false IRS documents, and armed theft of private property from American families, WFS has demonstrated complete contempt for the rule of law.

The evidence is overwhelming, undeniable, and completely uncontested by WFS:
- WFS issued a 1099-C cancelling the debt, then continued collection
- WFS failed to validate debt as required by federal law  
- WFS ignored lawful billing error notices
- WFS admits they are not the contract party but act as if they are
- WFS ordered nighttime theft of private property without legal authority
- WFS destroyed evidence by immediately selling the stolen vehicle
- **WFS has produced ZERO evidence supporting their position in over 13 months**
- **WFS cannot counter Plaintiff's evidence because it is undeniable**

These are not legal errors - this is systematic fraud and theft. WFS's complete silence on the merits after thirteen months proves they know they are entirely wrong but hope to win through procedural manipulation rather than facts and law.

The federal statutes cited establish clear violations that destroy any claimed rights. WFS forfeited all collection rights through statutory non-compliance. The corporate identity fraud violates due process. The nighttime theft of a family vehicle constitutes criminal conduct.

No federal court should dignify this corporate thuggery with jurisdiction. This case belongs in state court where Plaintiff's constitutional rights as an American citizen and victim of corporate theft can be vindicated without federal court resources being wasted on what amounts to organized crime dressed in corporate clothing.

**WHEREFORE**, Plaintiff respectfully requests this Court grant this Motion to Remand and remand this action to the state court from which it was removed, and grant such other relief as the Court deems just and proper. 

I keep researching the actions of the representatives of the defendant and I keep running into words like 'grounds for disbarment' or 'professional misconduct'. I'm not looking to ignite any criminal investigations into this further by the federal agencies that would find jurisdiction, but it does appear that there may be a massive criminal fraud action to be uncovered.

For the record, previously the Plaintiff capped damages at $50,000 as to not exceed the 7th District's limits, to avoid having to switch to the circuit court as the damages have well exceeded the $50,000 limit for county court. Since the actions of the defendant are still defiant and offensive in nature, that offer is officially rescinded. Once this case is brought back to Volusia County Florida, the Plaintiff will be filing the necessary motions to move to the higher court for cases exceeding $50,000. The Plaintiff will be pursuing the maximum amount of damages as permitted by law and decency.
